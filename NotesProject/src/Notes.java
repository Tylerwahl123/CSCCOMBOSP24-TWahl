public class Notes {
//	9) Int, double, char and boolean are primitive types, not objects
//	Null = no object
//	Primitive types do not provide methods
//	Objects from wrappers are immutable
//	BigInteger is implemented using an array of ints, similar to the way a string is implemented using an
//	array of chars
//	printRow takes two parameters
//	Immutable : an object, that once creator, cannot be modified. Strings are immutable
//	Unified modeling language defines a graphical way to summarize this information
//	Points and rectangles are mutable objects, their attributes can be modified
//	Strings and integers cannot be modified
	
//	10 & 11) Defining a class creates a new object type
//	Every object belongs to an object type
//	The “new” operator instantiates objects; that is, it creates new instances of a class (like a building
//	blueprint)
//	Getter: A method that returns the value of an instance variable
//	Setter: Method that assigns a value to an instance variable
//	Override : To replace a default implementation of a method, such as toString
//	Instance method: A non-static method that has access to this and the instance variables
//	Constructor is a special method that initializes the instance variables of a newly constructed object
//	Shadowing occurs when a local variable or parameter has the same value as an attribute
	
//	12) Encode: To represent one set of values using another set of values by constructing a mapping
//	between them
//	Class Variable : A variable declared within a class as static. Only one copy of a class variable
//	Sequential Search: An algorithm that searches array elements, one by one, until a target value is found
//	Binary Search: An algorithm that searches a sorted array by starting in the middle, comparing an element
//	to the search target, and eliminating half of the remaining elements
	
//	13) Helper method: A method that implements part of a more complex algorithm; often it is not
//	particularly useful on its own
//	Top-down design: A method that implements part of a more complex algorithm; often not particularly
//	useful on its own
//	Selection sort: A simple sorting algorithm that searches for the smallest or largest elements n times
//	Merge sort: A recursive sorting algorithm that searches for the smallest or largest elements n times
//	off -by-one: A common programming mistake in iterating too few or too many times
//	Static Context: Parts of a class that run without reference to a specific instance of a class
//	Collection: A java library class, like ArrayList, that represents a group of objects
//	Wrapper Method: A method that calls another method without doing much additional work
	
//	14) Encapsulation: (keeping data secure/private, providing the user with getters and setters)
//	Composition: (Is a) class contain references to instances of another class
//	Inheritance: (Has a) One class extends another class  (Ex: Animal = Parent class -> Dogs are apart of parent class)
//	- Part of object oriented parent class
//	- Sub class: more specific but inherits all data members & methods in parent classes
//	- Super (parent) class must exist before Sub (child) class [super.method]
